I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://ml.cs.sfu.ca/">School of Computing Science</a> at <a href="http://sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> where I work as a part of the <a href="http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca/">NatLang Lab</a> advised by <a  href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/">Professor Anoop Sarkar</a>. 

I work at the intersection of `Natural Language Processing` and `Deep Learning`. I'm broadly interested in building multilingual models. My current research focus is on machine learning for `multilingual models for neural machine translation` and `computational decipherment`. Until recently, I was working on `explainability` for neural machine translation.

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science in 2018 from SFU. I defended my MSc thesis in July 2018 on <a href="http://summit.sfu.ca/item/18588">natural language decipherment</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/">Professor Anoop Sarkar</a> and <a  href="http://www.sfu.ca/~popowich/public/Home.html">Professor Fred Popowich</a>. Prior to joining SFU, I was an undergrad at <a href="">Vellore Institute of Telchnology</a> from 2011 - 2016 working towards an integrated Masters degree in Software Engineering.

<!--p>In the past, I was a research intern at <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aida#section-overview">Aida Corp</a> (now a part of <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.visioncritical.com/">Vision Critical</a>) on customer support automation. Prior to joining SFU, I earned my integrated Masters in Software Engineering in 2016 from <a href="">Vellore Institute of Telchnology</a>, India advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ppJfQbMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Bharadwaja Kumar</a>, where I worked on automatic construction of Telugu-English parallel corpus.</p-->

I occasionally play the percussion instrument [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla).
